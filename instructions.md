Rules of the Game

Objective: Be the first to bring all four pawns to your home triangle.

Getting Started: Players need a roll of 5 to move a pawn from the nest to the starting square.

Movement: Roll two dice. You can move one piece the total, or two pieces using each die's value.
If you roll doubles, you move, and then you get to roll again.
If you roll three consecutive doubles, your most advanced piece is sent back to the nest (unless it's in the final home path).

Capturing (Eating): If you land on an opponent's pawn, you send their pawn back to the nest and move one of your pieces 20 spaces forward.

Safe Spaces: Squares with a circle, and all starting/colored spaces, are safe; pawns here cannot be captured.


Winning: All four pieces must land in the home triangle with an exact roll. Getting a piece home gives a 10-space bonus for your other tokens.
